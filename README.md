# Tone-Row-Generator
it creates, inverts, retrogrades and transposes town rows

I was having to write tone rows in my music theory class, and i was like i could code that. So here we are, 4 hours later :)

its pretty simple, i used lots of simple functions and it can break pretty easily i guess but its good enough. lots of fun to make tho, except for the invert function
